Allows easy integration with marketo from ruby. You can synchronize leads and fetch them back by email, id, list names, etc.
By default this is configured for the SOAP wsdl file: http://app.marketo.com/soap/mktows/1_4?WSDL but this is configurable when you construct the client
 e.g. client = Rapleaf::Marketo.new_client(<access_key>, <secret_key>, (api_subdomain = 'na-i'), (api_version = '1_5'), (document_version = '1_4'))
